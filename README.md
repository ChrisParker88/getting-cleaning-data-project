###Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

Repo for the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

###Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. [The data is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 

[The data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

###Altering the run_analysis.R code for use on your local machine

Change the directory in line 1 of the code to the appropriate location for creating foldes and files for use in this analysis.

###Project requirements

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Information about the variables

Refer the Codebook.md file for a description of the analysis steps and variables.
